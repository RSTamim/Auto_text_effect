I'm Tamim Hasan, a React web developer in computer science. I've been doing this for over a decade. This course was created to share my knowledge and experience with you.

This new course teaches students how to install Visual Studio Code and its extensions. Then we start from scratch with each project. After finishing HTML, it's on to CSS and JavaScript. Building in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript is fine. This guide explains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax.


Every project is started from scratch and finished without using copied code. Then they are used on the project to ensure everyone understands.
